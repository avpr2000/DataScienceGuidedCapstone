<h1>Guided Capstone Project Report</h1>
<h2>Big Mountain Resort Recommendations</h2>
<p>Big Mountain Resort charges $81us per ticket, and each visitor buys on average 5-day tickets ($ 405 us), and with the numbers of visitors provided (350.000) the annual revenue will be $ 141.350.000 us. The model supports an increase of ~13us - $94 per ticket, increasing the revenue by $23.150.000 per season.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Following the business scenarios and the conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Closing 10 runs could reduce the support for the ticket on $1.75 us each, $3.062.500 us all season.</li>
<li>Incrementing one run, one chair and add 150ft to vertical drop will increase in $1.99 us the ticket - $82.99 us and the revenue on&nbsp;$3.474.638 us.</li>
<li>Adding 2 acres of snow to the last scenario will not show any change to the revenue.</li>
<li>Increasing the longest run by 0.2 miles to boast 3.5 miles length, will require 4 more acres of snowmaking coverage and this will not make a difference in the ticket price/revenue.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new additional chair will add $1,540,000 operating costs this season, supported with the business scenario 2 the revenue will not be affected.</p>
